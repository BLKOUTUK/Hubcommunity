## Deployment Summary

Your application can be deployed in several ways, depending on your preferences and requirements:

### Preview Before Deployment

Before deploying, you can preview your built application locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Deployment Options

1. **Netlify** - Great for static sites with continuous deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:netlify
   ```
   See `deployment-netlify.md` for detailed instructions.

2. **DigitalOcean** - Multiple options available:
   - App Platform: `npm run deploy:digitalocean`
   - Droplet: `npm run deploy:digitalocean-droplet`
   - Docker: `npm run deploy:docker`
   
   See `deployment-digitalocean.md` for detailed instructions.

3. **AWS** - Deploy to AWS services:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:aws
   ```
   See `deployment-aws.md` for detailed instructions.

4. **Docker** - Containerized deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:build
   npm run docker:run
   ```
   See `deployment-docker.md` for detailed instructions.

### Recommended Approach for Quick Deployment

For the quickest and easiest deployment, Netlify is recommended:

1. Build your application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to Netlify:
   - Either use the script: `npm run deploy:netlify`
   - Or drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify's dashboard

This will give you a live URL where you can view your deployed application within minutes.
