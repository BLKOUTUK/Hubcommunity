## Overview

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the BLKOUTHUB rewards and gamification system. The goal is to ensure all components work correctly individually and together, providing a reliable and engaging experience for community members.

## Test Environment

- **Development Environment**: Local development machine
- **Testing Environment**: Local testing environment
- **Staging Environment**: Render deployment (pre-production)
- **Production Environment**: Render deployment (production)

## Test Types

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
3. **System Testing**: Testing the entire system as a whole
4. **Performance Testing**: Testing system performance under load
5. **Security Testing**: Testing for security vulnerabilities
6. **User Acceptance Testing**: Testing with real users

## Test Cases

Detailed test cases for each component are provided in separate files:

- `test_member_manager.py`
- `test_rewards_manager.py`
- `test_event_manager.py`
- `test_notification_manager.py`
- `test_heartbeat_integration.py`
- `test_dashboard.py`
- `test_api_endpoints.py`

## Test Execution

1. Run unit tests for each component
2. Run integration tests for component interactions
3. Run system tests for end-to-end functionality
4. Run performance tests for system under load
5. Run security tests for vulnerabilities
6. Conduct user acceptance testing with community managers

## Test Reporting

Test results will be documented and reported, including:

- Test case execution status (pass/fail)
- Issues identified during testing
- Recommendations for improvements
- Performance metrics and benchmarks

## Issue Tracking

Issues identified during testing will be tracked and prioritized for resolution based on severity:

- **Critical**: System crash, data loss, security breach
- **High**: Major functionality not working
- **Medium**: Feature not working as expected
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic defects

## Test Schedule

1. **Unit Testing**: Ongoing during development
2. **Integration Testing**: After component completion
3. **System Testing**: After all components are integrated
4. **Performance Testing**: Before deployment to staging
5. **Security Testing**: Before deployment to staging
6. **User Acceptance Testing**: After deployment to staging

## Test Completion Criteria

Testing is considered complete when:

1. All test cases have been executed
2. All critical and high-severity issues have been resolved
3. System performance meets requirements
4. Security vulnerabilities have been addressed
5. User acceptance criteria have been met
