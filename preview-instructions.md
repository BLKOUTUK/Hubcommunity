## Preview Instructions

To preview your application locally:

```bash
# First, build your application
npm run build

# Then, start the preview server
npm run preview
```

This will build your application and serve it locally on a port (typically http://localhost:4173). You can access this URL in your browser to preview your application as it would appear in production.

The preview server is useful for testing your built application before deploying it to a production environment.
