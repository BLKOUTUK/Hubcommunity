# Test Issues and Recommendations

## Overview

The test suite encountered several issues when running against the actual implementation. This document summarizes the issues and provides recommendations for fixing them.

## Issues and Recommendations

### API Endpoint Issues

1. **Missing or Different Endpoints**
   - Several API endpoints are missing or have different paths than expected
   - Example: `/api/rewards/user/{member_id}/award-points` returns 404

   **Recommendation**: Update the test suite to match the actual API endpoints or update the API to include the expected endpoints.

2. **Response Format Differences**
   - Some responses have different formats than expected
   - Example: `notification_id` is missing from notification creation response

   **Recommendation**: Update the test suite to match the actual response format or update the API to return the expected format.

### Method Signature Issues

1. **Missing Methods**
   - Several methods are missing from the implementation
   - Examples:
     - `MemberManager.delete_member`
     - `MemberManager.get_members_by_type`
     - `MemberManager.validate_member_type`
     - `EventManager.get_events_by_type`
     - `EventManager.get_upcoming_events`
     - `EventManager.get_past_events`

   **Recommendation**: Implement the missing methods or update the test suite to match the actual implementation.

2. **Different Method Signatures**
   - Some methods have different signatures than expected
   - Example: `MemberManager.update_member` doesn't accept a `name` parameter

   **Recommendation**: Update the test suite to match the actual method signatures or update the implementation to match the expected signatures.

### Data Structure Issues

1. **Different Data Structures**
   - Some data structures are different than expected
   - Example: Achievement structure has `criteria` instead of `requirements`

   **Recommendation**: Update the test suite to match the actual data structures or update the implementation to match the expected structures.

2. **Missing Fields**
   - Some fields are missing from the data structures
   - Example: `qr_code_data` is missing from QR code generation response

   **Recommendation**: Update the test suite to match the actual data structures or update the implementation to include the expected fields.

### Implementation Issues

1. **Failed Operations**
   - Some operations fail when they should succeed
   - Examples:
     - `award_points` returns `{"success": false}`
     - `create_notification` returns `{"success": false}`

   **Recommendation**: Debug the implementation to identify and fix the issues causing the operations to fail.

2. **Empty Data**
   - Some data collections are empty when they should contain data
   - Example: `notifications` array is empty when it should contain notifications

   **Recommendation**: Ensure that the data is being properly saved and retrieved.

## Action Plan

1. **Update Test Suite**
   - Update the test suite to match the actual implementation
   - Focus on method signatures, data structures, and API endpoints

2. **Implement Missing Methods**
   - Implement the missing methods in the appropriate classes
   - Ensure that the implementations match the expected behavior

3. **Fix Implementation Issues**
   - Debug and fix the issues causing operations to fail
   - Ensure that data is being properly saved and retrieved

4. **Run Tests Incrementally**
   - Run tests for one component at a time
   - Fix issues before moving on to the next component

5. **Document Changes**
   - Document any changes made to the implementation or test suite
   - Update the API documentation to reflect the actual implementation
